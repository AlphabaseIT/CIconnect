CIconnect: CodeIgniter Connect - Facebook PHP SDK

This extension for the CodeIgniter PHP framework enables you, as a web application developer, to quickly and effectively include the strength of the Facebook PHP SDK into your application.

The CodeIgniter library and model are based on the official Facebook SDK for PHP (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/php/).

You can have the extension set up within minutes, following the example code and the documentation.
Followed by the easy installation are all the benefits of social login with Facebook, publishing to timeline, getting the user profile and sharing any data when needed.

We're building a community with support and collaboration on this GitHub-page, so feel free to join in and contribute to the project.
